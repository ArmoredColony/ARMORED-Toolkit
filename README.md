# ARMORED-Toolkit

## What is it?
A FREE Blender Add-on containing my personal Scripts, Matcaps, Themes and Keymaps. 

Everything is optional, except for the scripts which will automatically get installed with the addon and appear in the Search Menu (F3) with the 'ARMORED' prefix.

Note: some scripts are context sensitive, which means they will only appear under certain conditions (some only show up in Edit Mode, others in Object Mode, etc. 

For a full list of included scripts check the 'Operators' folder.

## How to install?
You can download as ZIP and install just like any other Blender Add-on:

Edit> Preferences> Add-ons> Install> Select the .zip file> Click the Checkbox to finally enable it.

...or you can git pull directly into your addons folder.

Afterwards, you can enable the specific resources that interest you. NOTE: the scripts are always installed no matter what.

## What if I don't wan't all the scripts?

Inside the Armored-Toolkit ZIP there's a sub-folder called **Operators**. Everything there is self contained so you can easily extract the individual scripts that interest you and use them without even installing the addon. Use them however you like!

## Can you add this feature/script?
I usually focus on scripts that facilitate my personal workflow. Ideas are always welcome but there are no guarantees I will code what you want, specially since this is a free addon.

## I found a bug!
Let me know about it and I will probably fix it since I use these scripts too!
