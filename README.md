# ARMORED-Toolkit

## What is it?
It's a FREE Blender Add-on containing my personal Scripts, Matcaps, Themes and Keymaps. 

Everything is optional, except for the scripts which will automatically appear in the Search Menu (F3 or Spacebar) with the "ARMORED" prefix.

Note: some scripts are context sensitive, which means they will only appear under certain conditions (some only show up in Edit Mode, others in Object Mode, etc. 

For a full list of included scripts check the 'Operators' directory.

## How to install?
You can download as ZIP and install just like any other Blender Add-on:
Edit> Preferences> Add-ons> Install> Select the .zip file> Click the Checkbox to finally enable it.

...or you can git pull directly into your addons folder.

Afterwards, you can enable the specific resources that interest you. NOTE: the scripts are always installed no matter what.

## I only care about X script, can I take it?
Sure!

Inside the Armored-Toolkit ZIP folder there's a sub-folder called **Operators**. Everything there is self contained so you can easily extract any individual scripts that interest you. If you already installed the add-on, you can also click the 'Operators Folder' which takes you to the same directory.

Learn from them, put them in your own add-on, whatever!

## Can you add this feature/script?
Maybe. Feel free to share your ideas, just remember this is a free add-on, which means I'm not obligated to do much :p

## I found a bug!
Let me know about it and I will probably fix it since I use these scripts too!
