# ARMORED-Toolkit

## What is it?
It's a FREE Blender Add-on containing my personal Scripts, Matcaps, Themes and Keymaps. 

Everything is optional, except for the scripts which will immediately appear in the Search Menu (F3 or Spacebar) when typing "Armored", whether you want to or not muahaha.

Note that some scripts are context sensitive, which means they will only appear under certain conditions (some only show up in Edit Mode, others in Object Mode, etc.

## How to install?
You can download as ZIP and install just like any other Blender Add-on, or you can git pull directly into your addons folder.

Enable the "Armored Toolkit" add-on in your preferences and  select what resources you are interested in.

## I only care about X script, can I take it?
Sure!

Inside the Armored-Toolkit folder there's a sub-folder called **Operators**. Everything there is self contained so you can easily extract individual scripts that interest you and disable/delete my add-on afterwards.

Learn from them, put them in your own add-on, whatever!

## Can you add this feature/script?
Maybe. Feel free to share your ideas, just remember that this is a free add-on, which means I'm not really obligated to do much.

## I found a bug!
Let me know about it and I will probably fix it since I use these scripts too!
