# ARMORED-Toolkit

This is my free collection of modeling Scripts for Blender, bundled into a single Addon for easy installation. It also includes *optional* extras like my personal Blender Theme, Matcaps and Hotkeys which are all *disabled* by default.

## How to Install?
- Click on the *Code* button and download the ZIP file.
- Go to **Blender Preferences> Addons> Install** and select the ZIP you downloaded. 

That's it! Scripts will automatically appear in the search menu (F3) and will be marked with the ARMORED prefix. Note that some scripts will be hidden based on the context. For example: **Flatten** only works in Edit mode and will not appear in Object mode.

## Notable Scripts
- **Lattice**: Create a new lattice deformer that is automaticaly sized and rotated to fit the selected objects.
- **Vitaly Poke**: Convert a selection of quads to a diamond-shaped pattern (similar to Vitaly Bulgarov in XSI).
- **Delete and Grid Fill**: Delete the selected faces and fill them with a grid of quads.
- **Flatten**: Flatten your selection to the averaged normals, a world axis or the active face.
- **Connect**: Create an edge loop through a selection of faces (similar to Maya, Max or Modo).
- **Select Adjacent**: Selects the adjacent components and deselects the previous ones (like XSI).
- **Fast Subdivision**: Applies a subsurface modifier with a lower `limit_surface` value for faster subdivisions with no quality loss. 
- **Edge to Pipe**: Convert a curve or edge selection into a pipe (like Modo)
- **Fast Bevel**: Combine the edge and vertex bevel tools into a single one. On face selections it will bevel the face border.
- **Fast Crease**: Instantly apply full crease/uncrease to your selection. Can also crease by angle or face selection border.
- **Hide**: Toggle the visibility of an object by only pressing H (like Maya).
- **Primitives**: new primitives with divisions/sides you can interactively increase or decrease by scrolling; plus quadsphere and single vertex, etc.
- **Focus**: Same as Blender's View Selected but capable of centering the mesh when nothing is selected.
- **Compare**: Select multiple elements in the outliner and RMB>Compare to isolate one at a time by scrolling.
- **Select by Trait**: select triangles, select ngons or select non-quads (they appear separately in the search menu).
- **Silhouette**: In solid shade mode, toggle a silhouette view of the current viewport on and off.

*There's more but those are some of my favorites.*
